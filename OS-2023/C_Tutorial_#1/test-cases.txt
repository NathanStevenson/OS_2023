Ideas for Test Cases:
- strings on each line up to 40 characters, does it work for single character? or if there are more then 40 characters?
- what if there is only one line?
- does tail-remove work for a file with only two lines?
- don't have to worry abt empty lines --> input should be very simple with no empty lines
- if there are no lines then return empty

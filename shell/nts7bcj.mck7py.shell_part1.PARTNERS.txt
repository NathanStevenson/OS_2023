Description: 
- Pair programmed:
    - I/O redirection
    - fork and exec commands with no arguments
    - fork and exec commands with arguments
    - wait on forked commands and print their exit status
    - a lot of development and debugging also took place while pair programming
    - most of the new pipe behavior
- Helped debug:
    - I/O Redirection (test cases where redirection was in beginning or middle)
    - lots of debugging on why there was non-deterministic behavior for commands that had 2+ pipes
    - a lot of the piping logic for the children
    - Solved the issue with running commands with 2+ pipes

    - Went to Office Hours to help debug the non-deterministic issues
    - Helped debug the error "/bin/false < |"
